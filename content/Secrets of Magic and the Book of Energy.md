One of the greatest symbols of power and strength comes from the study of magic. 

Magic in Arybin comes in several different fields, though only one field is the most well established and well known. This is the **[[Study of Light]]**, or simply called Light Theory or Lightlore. Lightlore is commonly accepted in all corners of Arybin, and is the most popular weapon in warfare and against the [[monsters of the corruption]].

However the [[Study of Light]] comes almost hand in hand with a second field, a field that is widely recognized as a requirement to progress Light Theory. This field is commonly known as **[[Steelscience]]**, or Steel Lore. 

[[Steelscience]] can produce the *[[Aurin]]* used to channel light through a *[[filter stone]]*, producing the desired light frequency used to perform magic. However, [[Steelscience]] used on its own is but a small and mostly experimental field, as the cost of using [[Aurin]] to perform magic is substantially greater than simply using Lightlore.









**Dark Energies:**

**Aune**
- Commonly referred to as "dark" energy, Aune is the final stage of energy (at least, the commonly accepted final stage in Energy Theory).
- Aune can be recharged by the close association of another energy form, where it gets repowered and converted to another energy form.
- Once Aune decays, it dissipates as "Entropy", that is, chaos. The study of chaos and chaos theory is a convoluted and dark path, though the common concensus is that chaos is unsavory to the applications of nature.
