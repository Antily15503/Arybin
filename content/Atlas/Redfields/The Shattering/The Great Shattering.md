In the year 89 [[Ascension Calendar|AA]], the mighty [[Celestial Imperium]] was shattered into a bloody conflict following the death of the **Ascended Sun**. Known as [[The Great Shattering]], it is a still ongoing conflict that still plagues a large portion of the prosperous [[Redfield]] continent.

**Overview**

In the weeks leading to the death of His Royal Leader and the ruling Glass Throne, stability within the Celestial Imperium was as low as it has been in decades. Most of this tension came from the High Houses, specifically the "Red Houses" (House Ignadiaz and Ilyane) and the "Blue Houses" (House Merrborn and Vam√©s), and the deep-rooted rivalry that occurred between the two royal factions. 

Though, as the years approached the death of His Royal Leader, almost all of the Imperial Houses had rivalries and begrudging allies, all with agendas of their own. As Count Ivanin of [[House Merrborn]] put it in one interview: "The council is like a den of sharks, and the crownland the blood we're all eyeing."

Tension was also present in the different provinces within the Celestial Imperium, consisting mostly of native uprisings in the newly set up Western Colonies, and the spread of "Radical Thoughts" in Central Imperium. Although these ideas and movements were swiftly put down, some of these "proto-rebellions", such as the Revolt of Abron Forest led by Nui Aunc (79 [[Ascension Calendar|AA]]), were large enough to cause dissent and worry within the larger Imperial populace. 

In the year 82 [[Ascension Calendar|AA]], [[Celestial Preservation Committee#**Church of the New Ascension**|Church of New Ascension]] ruled in the controversial [[Ruling of Whitehaven]] to ban the publication of "The True Records of Light", a study published by Thomson Calvard that narrated and studied the rise and fall of the central powers of the Redland that he called "Celestialism" in an academic and slightly critical light. Although the study was warmly received by Academics and Auramancers within the Imperium, the Church banned it for it's critical view of the government and religion.

Naturally, this move caused a lot of outrage within Academic circles, which peaked in intensity when [[House Mazorve]], who was known for their rather radical way of thinking, publicly sided with the Mage Guilds and several Academic Circles in their opposition against the [[Celestial Preservation Committee#**Church of the New Ascension**|Church of New Ascension]]. In retaliation, His Royal Leader, who's illness up until now was still unknown, launched a fierce attack against the power and influence of House Mazorve and the Mage Guilds, deeply polarizing the Noble Houses and the population at large.
