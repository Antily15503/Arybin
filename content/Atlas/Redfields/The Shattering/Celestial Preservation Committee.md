### **Overview**
The [[Celestial Preservation Committee]], or the "Celestial Guards", is the remaining de-jure government of the former [[Celestial Imperium]]. They consist of the remaining Imperial Houses that are loyal to the government, as well as the soldiers and garrisons of [[White Imperia]], Rafatland, and Amescord, who pledged fealty to the [[Celestial Preservation Committee |Committee]] following [[The Great Shattering]]. 

The Preservation Committee is currently led by the Emergency Council of Glass, or simply the Emergency Council, with Lord Avinad of House Imperia the de-Jure representative of the remaining Celestial State. Although commonly viewed as the "face" and icon of the ideals of the Celestial State, Lord Avinad serves more like a Great Unifier holding the different aspects of the Preservation Committee together, adopting the title "The Preservationist", as opposed to his house title. 

Within the Committee, rival houses and faction leaders fight to consolidate power within the power vacuum that was once the Celestial State. Though most of these "petty squabbles" are put aside in the face of growing threat from the [[opposition]]. 

To all other factions, the Preservation Committee represents all things that made the Celestial Imperium strong and weak. A strong nobility-led coalition fighting to reinstate order and loyalty to the plains of the [[Redfield|Redfields]], the Preservation Committee aims to preserve the beauty and grace of the empire, promising the return of the prosperity that was stolen.
### History

**Post-Shattering**
Immediately after the resulting loss of communications across the Empire following [[The Great Shattering]], the remaining loyal houses, military leaders, and members of the Imperial House met at [[White Imperia]] to discuss plans of re-establishing the [[Celestial Imperium]] through military and diplomatic force. 

Representatives and mages of all the Imperial Houses were invited to join forces in the cause of "Preservation", though only houses [[Ignadiaz]], [[Merrborn]], and [[Aven]] accepted the invitation and pledged their loyalty to the rightful empire of the [[Redfield]]. With this, the Preservation Committee began to gear up for war, or as they called it, "reconquest". 

**War of Floraines**
Following the great consolidation of what was once the [[Celestial Imperium]], the Celestial Preservation Committee launched it's first major offensive in AA 91, against the lords of House [[Vam√©s]], who had pledged themselves to support
