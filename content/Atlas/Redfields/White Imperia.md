The City of the Twelve Gems, or White Imperia (Imperia for short), is the self-proclaimed center and capital of Arybin. Sitting in the center of the Imperial Penninsula that pinches the Sea of Marbor, White Imperia is the capital of the [[Celestial Imperium]], and the seat of the [[Twelve Imperial Houses]] and the **Glass Palace**.

Because of this, White Imperia is perhaps the most well developed and wealthy city in all of Arybin, serving as both an economic and political hub in both the [[Celestial Imperium]] and all of [[Redfield]]. White Imperia is also well known as the "City of Purity," due to the fact much of the city is dominated by castles and towers built from gold and white marble, the symbols of purity and sanctity. Most of this marble comes from the nearby mines of Arsemiel, where large marble and limestone quarries supplies the city with most of their construction resources.
##### **Cityscape:**
Those that enter the Imperial City during the day often report on being amazed at how bright the city seemed to be. Every day, the sun that shines from beyond the [[Sea of Marbor]] seem to be made more intense by the gleaming white towers that make up most of the cityscape in the Imperial City. Most of these towers are simple in their design, built for functionality rather than grandeur. However, the central city is where most of the more [[#^889194 |iconic landmarks]] and buildings sit, and as a result, receive the largest amount of travelers and tourists from all over the world.

The Imperial City is also as popular at night as it is during the day. During the night, floating orbs of light illuminate the busy streets of White Imperia, providing enough light to navigate through, relax, or engage with. On some streets, House Lights, instead of normal light, illuminate the streets of the Imperial City, in colors that reflect which of the [[Imperial Houses]] the region belonged to. When these house lights combine with lights from other houses, they could form a mosaic of different colors, which gives White Imperia a certain rainbow of colors during the night.

#### **History:**
White Imperia initially began as the humble capital of the [[Kingdom of Ahvernge]], known back then as Ahvergen City. Being the most prosperous kingdom out of all the others that fought for control in the Redlands, the Kingdom of Ahvernge led a conquest against all the rival powers in the [[War of Ascension]], uniting the most prosperous regions of the Redlands under the banner of the Ahverngen. In the succeeding [[Ceremony of the High Light]], Ahvergen City was declared the "Capital of the Imperium, and of all continents", and His Royal Leader has reigned on the glass throne from the renamed city ever since.
