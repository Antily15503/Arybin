The City of the Twelve Gems, or White Imperia (Imperia for short), is the self-proclaimed center and capital of Arybin. Sitting in the center of the Imperial Penninsula that pinches the Sea of Marbor, White Imperia is the capital of the [[Celestial Imperium]], and the seat of the [[Twelve Imperial Houses]] and the **Glass Palace**.

Because of this, White Imperia is perhaps the most well developed and wealthy city in all of Arybin, serving as both an economic and political hub in both the [[Celestial Imperium]] and all of [[Redfield]]. White Imperia is also well known as the "City of Purity," due to the fact much of the city is dominated by castles and towers built from gold and white marble, the symbols of purity and sanctity. 

During the day, the sunlight shines onto the brilliant white towers from beyond the Marbor Sea. The Imperia streets are full of busy merchantmen squabbling to passerby busy in their daily commute to work, and ships travel in and out of the docks of Orange on their way to other portions of [[Redfield]]. 

At night, however, lights of a million color dot the busiest regions of Imperia, reflecting the rainbow of colors controlled by the [[Imperial Houses]]. 



#### **History:**
White Imperia initially began as the humble capital of the [[Kingdom of Ahvernge]], known back then as Ahvergen City. Being the most prosperous kingdom out of all the others that fought for control in the Redlands, the Kingdom of Ahvernge led a conquest against all the rival powers in the [[War of Ascension]], uniting the entire Redlands under the banner of the Ahverngen. In the succeeding [[Ceremony of the High Light]], Ahvergen City was declared the "Capital of the Imperium, and of all continents", and His Royal Leader has reigned on the glass throne from the renamed city ever since.
