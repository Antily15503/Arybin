 
Light Theory revolves around the idea and discovery that magical energy comes from the power of light, and of the different colors said light is attuned to. Normal natural background light represents "raw light", that is, light so chaotic and unfiltered that the individual energy compositions within a band of visible light cancels itself out, leaving it not very useful for practical purposes. To make the light more useful, it must be purified and "cleaned", so to speak, so that the wavelengths are more uniform and malleable to channeling and attunement.

The Process of purifying light can be found in [[Light Purification]].

**Pure Light**


**Channeling**
Once Light is purified, and made uniform, it is ready to be channeled. Channeling is the act of passing light through a crystal or colored transparent medium that aligns the light to a certain color. 

In order to move light around,

**[[Light Attunement]]**
HIgher and more complex schools of light magic calls for pure forms of light on top of color requirements. Light sources have the capability to produce different "flavors" of light, based on the properties of the light waves that are emitted. 

The study of Light Attunement explores how light from, say, fires, candles, pure sunlight, or moonlight can be stored and used instead of background light in intricate and exact processes to achieve maximum efficiency.
