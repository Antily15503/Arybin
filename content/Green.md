*Aur ne Auia* - Redallian

*Green Attunement*, or Lifelight, is the fundamental attunement for all **vitality** manipulations.

Green Attunement is probably the largest attunement field in all of the light studies, and thus has many many classes of subdivisions.

**Constitution Study:**

**Amplification Study:**

**Tempura Study:**

**Momentivity Study:**
