*Aur Visa* - Redallian

*Yellow Attunement*, or Forcelight, is the fundamental attunement for all **force-based** manipulations.

By channeling Aurin through a yellow filter, the light is bent to wavelengths that give it more power in exchange for their vibrant hue, allowing it to force energy into their surrounding environment, allowing the resulting light attunement to produce various powers:

**Slow Attunement:**
A more ambient/slow form of yellow attunement comes in the form of a shockwave-like form, where the caster can cast a bubble of shockwave around them that pushes back. Although this spell can be controlled to only force air back in one direction, it's most simplest and easiest form comes in a ring of pressure that emanates from the caster. This form is easiest to cast and control, but weakest in terms of effectiveness and power, as strength is inversely proportional to affected region. 

More skill allows the caster to disable certain directions of pressure when casting, effectively concentrating their region on places they intend to cast at. 

**Acute Attunement:**
Acute Attunement is caused when force is concentrated in a small region. After the force builds up in one point in space, the release causes a spike of energy to resonate throughout the surrounding space in the form of a dangerous pulse of pressure. 

**Charge Attunement**
Charge Attunement, also known as "Windcasting", is a form of yellow attunement in which the caster produces a difference in pressure potential in regions of space around them. Since air flows from high pressure to low pressure, the result is a blast of wind that can be controlled in both magnitude and direction.
