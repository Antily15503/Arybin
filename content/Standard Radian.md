### **Overview:**
Standard Radian, also known as Standard Imperian, or Redlander, is the standard language mandated by the [[Celestial Imperium]] prior to [[The Great Shattering]]. Often seen as a language for the nobility and the elite, Standard Radian is often used by the Celestial Imperium, who imposed it as the standard language over all native tongues in the region after unification. 

#### **History:**
Despite being such a prominent language in modern Redland society, the origins of the Radian language (which includes Standard Radian but includes other variants and dialects) is quite unknown. Prominent priests of the Church of Ascension claims that the Radian language was a language derived from the Lord Ruler, through the powers of the Sun. Such blessing makes the language "pure" and fit to use as the imperial language of the Redlands.

However, notable scholars and historians, by studying the patterns of languages and tracing them through history, have proposed a different explanation for the existence of the Radian language. The Radian language, according to notable scholars from the School of Mages, claims that long ago a group of settlers from the Shattered Continent of [[Lorint]] arrived and settled in the eastern reaches of the [[Redfield|Redfields]] region. Their native language slowly mixed with the inhabitants of the native Redlander language, resulting in the earliest emergence of Radian.

### **Phonology:**
Standard Radian is often well known for its elegance and sound in its words. This is often due to the fact that Radian has lots of vowels, who mix together to form new vowels.
